In order to upload a new release, follow two steps:

1. First build the zip file by running 
   ```shell
   python -m build
   ```
   This has to be run from the directory that contains the file pyproject.toml. The files created by this operation will be stored in a directory called `dist/`

2. Upload the files to PyPI.org.
   ```shell
   python -m twine upload dist/new-version
   ```
   where new-version is the files created in the previous step.
